# Sample Coding Questions 01 Week 01

# 1) Defining Variables:
# Define an array variable with the following elements 1, 4, 7, 9.
arr = [1, 4, 7, 9]
print("Array:", arr)

print()  # spacer

# 2) Order of Operations:
# Define 4 variables a, b, c, d and give them the values 1, 2, 3, 4.
a, b, c, d = 1, 2, 3, 4

# Fully-bracketed version of: e = a - b ** c // d + a % c
# e = (a - ((b ** c) // d)) + (a % c)
e = a - (b ** c) // d + a % c

print("a, b, c, d =", a, b, c, d)
print("e =", e)

print()  # spacer

# 3) Formatting:
# Create a variable called “temperature” with the value 32.6.
# Then print: “The temperature today is: 32.600 degrees Celsius”
temperature = 32.6
print("The temperature today is: {:.3f} degrees Celsius".format(temperature))

print()  # spacer

# 4) Common Functions:
# Ask the user to input their age, save into userAge.
# For the user input, add 22.
# Then print the sentence followed by the value of userAge.
userAge = int(input("Enter your age: ")) + 22
print("Now showing the shop items filtered by age:", userAge)
